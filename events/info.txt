This repository contains:

- task.txt - original task description 
- generate.py - script that generates input data from task description
- solution.py - script with my task solution
usage: solution.py [-h] [--dT DT] [--i I] [--o O]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --dT DT     delta time
  --i I       input csv file with incidents
  --o O       output csv file with counts

- incidents.csv - example input file from task description
- counts.csv - output created by my solution.py for an example in task description
- task-example-out.txt - result from task description in text format (same contents as in counts.csv)

Both 'counts.csv' and 'task-example-out.txt' show result of calculating counts 
for an example in task description with my 'solution.py -dT 0.3'. 
This result is *different* from the one given in 
task description and reflects my understanding of the task.

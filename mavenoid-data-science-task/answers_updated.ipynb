      "                    I now own:LG 24LJ48440 TV w/ remote AKB 749 153 97NEW! LG 43UK6500AUA TV w/ remote AKB 753 756 04Because of work/home logistics, both products are in the same room, approximately 10-12 ft apart, on opposite walls.Apparently, each remote uses the *same* IR frequency so if I try to turn on the 43\" TV with one remote, the signal bounces off the glass and turns on the 24\" TV. And vice versa.Called tech support, said I should move the TVs further apart, which is not a viable solution. Also suggested I purchase their 'magic remote' for an additional $50.Opened a case with LG, had to follow-up 3x times after not receiving promised follow-up. Case was escalated and routed to the wrong department, and eventually rerouted back to TV support. Was told that the 'current technology' (remote IR) was limited and there was no solution they could offer (other than moving the products further apart... which, as previously noted, was not a viable option).The tech support agent offered one final solution: I should go out and buy another TV from a competitor. \n",

      "                            Hi Mralick,I want to start by apologizing for the frustrating phone experience.  That said, I may be about to frustrate you more.Using the same IR signal for the same product line is an industry standard (that's why universal remotes work).  No matter which brand you use, if you have two of those TVs, the same remote will affect both units.  So, yes, one solution is to use different brands if they must be positioned how they are (maybe you have another brand in another room you could swap?).Also, just to put this to rest: Magic Remotes still use IR for some functions, such as Power and Volume.  So I wouldn't go out and buy a magic remote to solve this.  It could help with interference during other functions, but power will still transmit an IR signal from a Magic Remote.If it's possible to re-arrange the room, you could have the two TVs back-to-back, so the IR reflection doesn't interfere (but watch out for windows/mirrors that may act as reflecting surfaces).Another option is to use the CEC feature that most of our TVs have.  CEC allows the TV's on/off and some other functions to be controlled by another device.  If you have one TV where the main use is an external device, like a gaming system, set-top box, or streaming device, you can enable Simplink on the TV, and it will automatically turn on/off when the other device does (I find turning off isn't always immediate though, my TV generally times out).While this would solve the on/off issue, other functions would likely still interfere, like Volume controls, or accessing the menu.  If the other functions aren't used often, you could put something in the way of the IR receiver on one unit to block the signal completely.  That could also work as a complete solution, if you can find a way to partially obstruct the IR signals on both units, so that you still have an angle from the sitting positions of each, but where the reflected signal won't have line of sight back to the other unit.I know it's frustrating.  I had the same issue a couple of years back, and had to use the CEC with partial obstruction method.I hope something in there helps!  Let me know.Thanks,~Ryan                        \n",

      "                            The frequency has nothing to do with it, it is IR or a wavelength near 940nm or 3.19x10E14 or 319 Terrahertz it could be modulated between 34khz and 56khz but that is also insignificant, it is the digital codes that are transmitted that your devices react to. Having said that, Ryan's answer is good, but there are other factors physical and aesthetic. The reflectivity of the room being most significant, if the walls are painted white it is unlikely you can block the signals effectively. You could try a layer or two of black nylon screen over the emitter on your remote to weaken the signal or find some other material that would absorb some but not all of the energy the remote is transmitting.  You can make a reflector from a piece of aluminum cut from a discarded can and bent at a 45 degree angle placed in front of the tv's receiver and aimed up, down, left or right and then bounce the signal off the ceiling or wall to reach the device, but this might not look appealing and could result in someone being cut. You can try to move one or both TVs left or right to avoid signals bouncing off one's screen to the others receiver. You can try to place materials that either absorb or reflect light in varying places in the room (or remove such items) to help control the path light travels unfortunately both the remotes and the receivers are designed to be wide angle devices which brings us to putting tubes reflective inside and opaque outside in front of both or either remotes or receivers.  Although these solutions may be effective, your wife or clients might find them unsightly and your cat might think they are toys. \n",

To get it to connect to the soundbar when I turn the TV on again, I have to re-select it from the list of paired devices (I don't have to re-pair) but it will not connect automatically.Another way to re-connect is to turn the soundbar on and off with the TV on. Then the TV says something like \"The SK1 device is requesting to connect. Do you accept?\" (well, words to that effect). And then it works.But I don't want to keep having to do this each time I turn my TV on !         \n",

Told me it was the soundbar (yeah, right) so I'll exchange it just to say I did it. Went to Costco to verify I wasn't crazy; their display model worked exactly as you & I expect it to work...\"Bluetooth\" setting holds even during power cycle.  Sooner or later I'm going to demand a replacement under warranty. \n",

That's why I want the Bluetooth to work as it's supposed to and as I paid for. I'm going to keep pursuing this issue even if -- as you pointed out -- I can work around it with another couple of clicks.  \n",

      " [\"\\nOver the past few days, we have been having WiFi connection trouble. We have a NetGear 5GHz router and the TV has been connected to it for over a year and we haven't had a problem. Recently however, the TV dropped WiFi connection frequently and would not connect in a steady manner. We looked up forums and tried things like, turning off the QuickStart feature, changing location settings, switching to the 2Hz line and doing power cycles on both the router and TV, but none has worked so far. I have also checked if the WebOS was up to date and it is. You can't predict when the TV will connect or if how long it will stay connected. It has gotten worse today and it has not connected to WiFi yet.  \"] \n",

      " ('0.9315', 'My TV has the same problem, at the beginning there was only a message that it had disconnected from the network and it had reconnected, this happened once a week and it was only those two messages, in November the messages from an unknown device were I began to appear sporadically, in December the messages come out every 10 minutes, my wifi is disconnected and I can not activate it, I connect by cable this gives me access to the internet but in minutes I lose it again which makes me use Netflix, Amazon Video and YouTube are practically impossible. In addition to this the remote control stops working, the cursor does not appear on the screen and the response of the buttons has a lag that makes it impossible to use it and a couple of weeks ago the TV restarts after the messages go out without stopping for several seconds. I would believe that this is a hardware problem as this affects the wireless communication of the remote control, so I think it is a problem with the wireless card, my TV is still under warranty but I want to know if it is a problem of software also since I see that several indicate that the problem was presented after the firmware update.TV: 55SJ8000Software Version:\\xa0 05.80.15Greetings from Peru!')\n",
